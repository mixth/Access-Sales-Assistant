		<p>Objective: Determine if agent is qualified to be an Access Producer; if yes, sign up.</p>
		
		<p>Overview: Ideally, you should phone screen the agent first. If unable to phone screen, drop-in is permissible. Agent should write enough nonstandard auto to allow for 1 or more Access apps/month. Their office should be organized in a reasonably professional manner, and there must be licensed agents writing the auto business.</p>
