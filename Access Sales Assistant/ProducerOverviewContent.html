		<p>Objective: Increase production or maintain the relationship.</p>
		
		<p>Overview: There are three types of calls under this category:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Training (Phase I, II, or III)</li>
			<li>Production (Phase I, II, or III)</li>
			<li>Service (Phase IV)</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>In a training call, your objective is to complete specific training that is designed to increase the agent's comfort level with Access and result in more production. A production call is designed to understand why the agent is not producing at an acceptable level and find ways to increase production. A service call is essentially a maintenance call. You are there to protect and enhance our relationship, ensure that the agent has the necessary tools to maximize production and gather market intelligence.</p>
