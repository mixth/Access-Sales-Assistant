		<p><b>Objective:</b> Determine why agency hasn't produced. Convince them to produce.</p>
		
		<p><b>Overview:</b> </p>
        <p>There are a number of reasons why an agency hasn't produced for us.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They aren't comfortable with our program.</li>
			<li>They write little or no nonstandard auto.</li>
			<li>Our rates are not competitive.</li>
			<li>Our commission does not meet their requirements.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>In your call, you will first want to understand why the agent hasn't produced. You will work your way toward gaining a production commitment from the agent. If a barrier exists that cannot be overcome, you should discuss next steps with your RD.</p>
