		<p>Thank agent for their time; set next visit.</p>
		
		<p>Close (Phase III)</p>
		<p>In your close, you will confirm the agent's acceptance of the features/benefits you have sold. If confirmation is not obtained, you will need to go back and understand the barrier(s) that remain and try to overcome them using the LSCPA model. If specific (quite us, write business), measurable (next 10 quotes, 1 or more apps) and time bounded (in the next X timeframe).</p>
